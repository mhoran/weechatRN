# WeechatRN

A [weechat](https://github.com/weechat/weechat) [relay](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#relay) client built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) using [Expo](https://expo.dev/). Heavily inspired by [weechat-android](https://github.com/ubergeek42/weechat-android).

## Installation

### iOS

Binary packages are distrubited via TestFlight for iOS users. Join the beta test group here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/0jFsQpot.

### Android

Binary packages are not built for Android. However, the project can be built locally and easily installed on a device.

## Getting Started

All examples below uses `example.com` as hostname, and `9001` as port number, but you should of course replace them with your own values as needed.

### weechat configuration:

```
/relay add weechat 9001
/set relay.network.password <your secret password>
```

Note that WeechatRN requires the relay to be configured with the "weechat" protocol, not the "irc" protocol.

### Webserver configuration (recommended for TLS):

It is recommended to front the relay with a webserver to provide TLS termination. This can easily be done with [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or other webservers.

Example `nginx.conf` which exposes `/weechat` on `example.com` with TLS:

```
http {
    # ...

    server {
        listen       443 ssl http2;
        server_name  example.com;

        ssl_certificate      cert.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key  cert.key;

        ssl_session_cache    shared:SSL:1m;
        ssl_session_timeout  5m;

        ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers  on;

        location /weechat {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:9001/weechat;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
          proxy_read_timeout 604800;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        }
	}
}
```

### WeechatRN configuration:

Fill in the hostname and password fields with the appropriate values. Check the SSL box if weechat is fronted with a proxy that supports it or if a SSL relay is configured in weechat itself.

Note that `/weechat` will be appended to the configured hostname. The path suffix is not configurable. However, the hostname may also contain a path. For example, if you have exposed the weechat WebSocket at `https://example.com/~user/weechat`, simply enter `example.com/~user` as the hostname, and check the SSL box. Do not include the scheme (`https://`) in the hostname field.

## Push Notifications (Beta)

Push notifications can be sent to WeechatRN for private messages and highlights with the use of a helper script.

To install the script, download [weechatrn.py](scripts/weechatrn.py?raw=1) to weechat's `python/autoload` directory. This directory may reside in `~/.weechat` or `~/.local/share/weechat`, depending on your setup.

Once downloaded, load the script via `/python load weechatrn.py`.

On (re)connect, WeechatRN will store a token in weechat, which will be used to send push notifications. Only a single token is stored at this time -- so only the most recently connected device will receive notifications.

By default, push notifications will be sent for all highlights and private messages. You can disable notifications for the current buffer with `/set plugins.var.python.WeechatRN.notify_current_buffer off`.

To disable push notifications without uninstalling WeechatRN, unload (`/python unload WeechatRN`) and remove the script from `python/autoload`.
